Biases can creep in at any stage of the AI task, from data collection methods, how we split/organise the test set, different algorithms, how the results are interpreted and deployed. Some of these topics have been extensively discussed and as a response, Kaggle has developed a course on AI ethics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Navigate to the [Kaggle tutorial on Identifying Bias in AI](https://www.kaggle.com/code/alexisbcook/identifying-bias-in-ai/tutorial). \n",

    "#### Task 2-a:\n",
    "Six types of bias are being described (historical bias, representation bias, measurement bias, aggregation bias, evaluation bias, deployment bias). Of these, the aggregation bias was new to me, because it is, as described in the tutorial, not as common. But as all forms of bias it is still important to keep this one in mind. \n",
    "Another form of bias could for example occur in the framing of questions when collecting data. For example questions in survey that are framed in a certain way so that one answer is more likely than another.\n",

    "First the model seems to not be able to classifie positive comments using negative words as not toxic. For example when commenting \"this is freaking great\" using some kind of slang to enhance the meaning of great, which is still a compliment, the model suddenly classifies it as toxic. This could show a bias towards slang language and can be seen in the following picture \n",
    "![image tried out example](screenshots/Comment_1.png) this example is refering to exercise three in the tutorial.\n",
    "The later hypothetical example has clear signs of racism in the classification of the data, since black and muslim are both being classified as toxic, even though they should not. This is refering to exercise four in the tutorial.\n",
    "The following examples in the kaggle tutorial https://www.kaggle.com/code/alexisbcook/identifying-bias-in-ai/tutorial introduced historical bias because the world (in this case the online community) already has this biased state - exercise five -  and measurement bias (beacause translations are often not fully accurate) - exercise six. Exercise six could also introduce aggregation bias.\n",
    "In the last example, in exercise 7, representation bias is implemented into the model, since the model was trained on data very differently to the actual use, in this case two different countries. \n"

I was already aware of all these, because of a psychology course i have been taking. The fairness criteria are very similar to criteria used in certain psychological experiments and surveys. Still it is interesting and new to consider them in relation to AI. Another criteria is individual fairness, which means that \"a predictor is fair if it produces similar outputs for similar individuals\" (Gajane and Pechenizkiy, 2018) this can be found in the article https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.03184.pdf, which also provides further information and is a good point to start investigating this topic in more depth.

While this is really hard to know, there are some approaches developed to know which features in your data (e.g. median_income in the housing dataset we used before) played a more important role than others in determining how your machine learning model performs. One of the many approaches for assessing feature importance is **permutation importance**.\n",
