    "Since starting with programming about two years ago, I have been interested in lots of things to do with programming, but especially AI. AI is becoming more and more important in everyday life and lots of discussions are being held about it. While having tried out some applications myself, for example ChatGPT and Midjourney, I am interested to learn how AIs really work and how the technology behind them functions. Furthermore, I have already taken a seminar on AI in general and would like to broaded my knowledge on the topic. Additionally I think especially for the creative sector, AI is a bringin on quite some changes, which is why I chose to take this seminar. \n",

    "- a better understanding of the role of AI in the creative sector\n",
    "- increase my coding skills in python and my understanding of code written by others\n",
